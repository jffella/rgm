# Recalbox Gamelist Manager

## Goal

This project aims at allowing an easier management of gamelist.xml files per hardware configuration in Recalbox.
I was no satisfied by scrapers management of rom files, as there was always missing pictures or duplicate rom entries in game menus. So I decided to create my own manager for Recalbox game lists. Here it is, in fully python.
At term, this poject should be available in both CLI and GUI.
